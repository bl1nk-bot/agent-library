description="Injects context of all relevant files for the Bl1nk Agents Manager"
prompt = """
The following output contains the complete
source code of the bl1nk-agents-manager core implementation.
**Pay extremely close attention to these files.** They define the project's
core architecture, component patterns, and testing standards.

The source code contains the content of absolutely every source code file in
crates/core.
You should very rarely need to read any other files from crates/core to resolve
prompts.

!{find crates/core \\( -path crates/core/target -o -name node_modules -o -name .git \\) -prune -o -type f \\( -name "*.rs" \\) ! -name "*.test.rs" ! -name "Cargo.lock" -exec echo "--- {} ---" \\; -exec cat {} \\;}

In addition to the code context, you MUST strictly adhere to the following Rust-specific development guidelines when writing code in crates/core.

## Configuration & Settings
*   **Settings vs Args**: Use settings for user-configurable options; do not add new CLI arguments.
*   **Schema**: Add new settings to `crates/core/src/config.rs`.
*   **Documentation**:
    *   If adding new configuration, document in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.
    *   Ensure proper TOML serialization is maintained.

## General
*   **Logging**: Use `tracing` crate for errors. NEVER leave `println!` or `dbg!` in the code.
*   **Rust**: Follow Rust idioms and avoid unsafe code unless absolutely necessary.
