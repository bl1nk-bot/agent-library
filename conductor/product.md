# Initial Concept
The world's largest open-source prompt library for AI.

# Product Definition

## Vision
To be the world's largest and most accessible open-source prompt library, empowering users of all ages and skill levels to effectively communicate with AI models. We aim to democratize prompt engineering through education, tooling, and community-driven content.

## Target Audience
- **AI Enthusiasts:** Individuals seeking to discover high-quality prompts and improve their prompt engineering skills across various models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
- **Developers:** Engineers looking to integrate curated prompts into their applications, utilize the dataset via API/MCP, or self-host the platform.
- **Learners:** Students and children (ages 8-14) beginning their journey with AI literacy through interactive and gamified experiences.

## Core Features
- **Prompt Library:** A searchable, curated collection of prompts for various use cases and AI models.
- **Interactive Guide:** A comprehensive "Book of Prompting" with chapters on techniques ranging from basics to advanced agents.
- **Prompts for Kids:** A dedicated, gamified section ("Promi") designed to teach children how to interact with AI safely and effectively.
- **Developer Tools:**
    - **CLI:** A command-line interface for browsing and using prompts.
    - **MCP Server:** A Model Context Protocol server for integrating prompts directly into AI assistants.
    - **API/Data Access:** Access to the prompt dataset via JSON/CSV or API.
- **Self-Hosting:** Complete support for deploying a private instance of the library with custom branding and authentication.
- **Community Integration:** Mechanisms for users to contribute, rate, and improve prompts (e.g., GitHub sync).
