        # Bun currently doesn't have a direct 'audit' command like npm/pnpm. 
        # We can skip this step or use a workaround if needed, 
        # but for now let's focus on linting which covers code security.
        # Alternatively, we can use 'npm audit' if package-lock.json exists, but we are switching to bun.
        # We will comment this out until Bun supports audit or we add a specific tool.
        # run: bun run audit
